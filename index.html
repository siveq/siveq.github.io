<p style="color:Black;">I'm currently a sophomore at Bob Jones University studying Spanish.</p> 
<p style="color:Black;">My goal is to eventually go into some sort of vocational ministry. I'm especially interested in South America or Mexico but I recognize there is also a large need here in the United States.</p>

<p style="color:Black;"> My family has been in ministry all my life. My father works as the camp director of Camp Assurance a small Christian camp in Illinois. I have spent 4 summers on camp staff and this past summer I was an intern at my home church.</p>
